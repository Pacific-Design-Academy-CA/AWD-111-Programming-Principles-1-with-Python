        - python a5p1.py input_file.txt exception_file.txt
- The students are expected to complete the following task using the two files:
    - Create two list of lines by taking both of the files as input, name them: inputLineList & exceptWordList
    - Tokenize all the words from the sentences in each index of inputList and create inputWordList
    - Remove duplicate words from the inputWordList 
    - Filter all the similar words from inputWordList which are available in exceptWordList and create: filteredList
    - Sort filteredList
    - Print the longest word length from filteredList
    - Print all the content of filteredList from the next line
